                        <p>I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work as a game developer intern at Parma Games, where I am gaining practical experience in using Unity and C# to develop a role-playing game (RPG). Through this internship, I have been involved in various aspects of game development, including game mechanics design, scripting, and debugging.</p>
                        <p>As part of my training, I have had the opportunity to participate in online training sessions that have expanded my knowledge of game design principles and programming best practices. I have also collaborated with a team of experienced game developers, who have provided valuable guidance and mentorship throughout the project.</p>
                        <p>With each passing day, I am becoming more proficient in using Unity and C# to create engaging and immersive gaming experiences. I am confident that the skills and knowledge I am gaining through this internship will serve me well as I continue my journey towards becoming a successful game developer.</p>

                        <p>I am honored to have been a part of the "100 Women Developers", 500-hours web development course, which was sponsored by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, Farmasi, and Fenerbahce University. The program has provided me with an extensive and comprehensive technical education, covering a wide range of topics, including Introduction to Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Fundamentals, Advanced Database Training, Basic and Advanced Web Programming, and more.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the course, I have gained practical experience in developing ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API applications, as well as programming with React for front-end development and Node.js for back-end development. The program has also provided training in React Native for mobile programming.</p>
                        <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this community of women developers and have gained valuable knowledge and skills that I will apply as I continue to pursue a career in web development.</p>

                        <p>I have had a diverse academic background, beginning with my undergraduate studies in Psychology at Bogazici University, which I completed in 2015. During my studies, I had the opportunity to broaden my perspective by participating in the Erasmus program at Université Paris Cité between 2013-2014.</p>
                        <p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Psychology at Istanbul Bilim University from 2015-2018. Following this, I began my PhD studies in Organizational Behavior at Marmara University in 2019, which I am currently pursuing.</p>
                        <p>While I am deeply committed to my academic pursuits, I have recently developed a keen interest in web development and have decided to expand my skills in this area. I am excited about the opportunities that this field offers, and I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in both my academic and professional pursuits.</p>
